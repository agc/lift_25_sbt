This file contains multiple Lift project templates:

- lift_basic is a basic Lift application with a built-in user class
             and nice use of Blueprint CSS

- lift_blank is a blank Lift project that does not have any model
             or CSS

- lift_mvc   is a Lift project that uses Lift's MVC support rather
             than view-first.  No model stuff, but Blueprint CSS
